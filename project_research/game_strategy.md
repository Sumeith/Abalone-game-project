**Please Note: Due to the fact that the scope of the project has been reduced, this is a guideline of how we could have designed the bot in the game.**

## Abalone game strategy

### :computer: Below is a guideline of how we can design the bot in the game. 

<!-- Please free to change and/or add more suggestions -->

1.	Don’t rush in; start defensively
	*	Plan ahead, don’t open up vulnerabilities in your own lines, and while ensuring that you are ready to pounce on any mistakes that the opponent might make.
	*	Wherever your marbles/counters are next to your opponent’s, carefully consider the effect of each possible push. Pushes tend to create many new possibilities for each side since as many as five marbles can change position at once (when three marbles push two).
	*	Keeping the marbles/counters close together is important. 
	*	Advance towards the centre. 
	*	It’s best to start advancing a line of three marbles toward the centre.

2.	Get to the centre.
	*	This is very important! 
	*	This gives the marbles/counters more mobility, and it is easier to situations quicker. Also, since the marbles/counters are in the centre, they are much safer.
	*	Keep the marbles/counters close to the centre of the board and force the opponent to move to the edges.
	*	If you can occupy the centre, you will also force your opponent’s marbles to stay near the edge

3.	Go on the offensive
	*	This is very important! Win Condition!
	*	While you should start your game defensively, eventually go on the offensive.
	*	The more marbles/counters that we have than the opponent, the easier the game gets, and we can play more aggressively.
4.      Keep marbles close together
        *       Keep marbles close together in the form  of a hexagon shape or mini heaxagon shapes.
        *       This provides increased  defence and attack.
        *       The hexagon shape enables you to push or defend in different directions[0,5].
5.      Do not rush to push the opponent's marble of the board
        *       Hasty decisions leads to more weaknesses.
        *       It could result in more of your marbles being pushed off.
        *       Could result in you losing the game. 

### :question: Other Strategies that we can consider including

1.	Blob technique
	*	Try and keep the marbles in a ball/hexagon shape. And wait for the opponent to make a mistake.

2.	Divide and Conquer
	*	Try to separate the opponent’s marbles into two or more groups. It will be easier to attack two smaller groups rather than one large group. 

3.	Abandon stragglers
	*	Don’t waste time trying to link up isolated marbles with your main group unless you can do it in just a move or two.

4.	Play patiently 
	*	When you’re not sure what to do, look for your least useful marble(s), and try to improve their positions.
